# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description 

An exercise with MIT xPro that tracks the real time locations of Boston's buses using MBTA's API, and displays those results with Google Maps type hybrid showing both default and satellite views. 

## How To Run

After cloning this repo, add your Google Maps API Key to the index.html file and your MBTA API key to the mapanimation.js file, load the index.html file in a browser window to check the current location of Boston's buses. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements  

I would like to have this generate a map with real time MTA data for the NYC subway and buses. And have the data update truly live rather than every 15 seconds.
